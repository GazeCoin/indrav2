# Documentation Documentation

If you find a mistake in our documentation, we'd be thrilled to receive a pull-request from you with the fix.

To get started, fork Indra & browse the files in `indra/docs/src`.

You can build our docs with the following command:

```
make docs
```

Once the docs are build, you can view them locally by opening docs/build/html/index.html in a web browser. Refresh the page to display changes after re-building.

If the docs look good locally, push changes to your fork & submit a PR to our repo. Thanks!
